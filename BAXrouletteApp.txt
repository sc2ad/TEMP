Goal: Implement a discord bot that will run a script rolling the 4 options below with a simple text command
FORMAT: ALL LABELS ARE NEWLINES AFTER THREE DASH MARKS
ALL OPTIONS ARE BULLET POINTS
THIS DOCUMENT IS UPLOADED TO THE BOT EVERY 24 HOURS, AT 10PM PST, OR WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT
FOR THE TIME BEING, ADDING NEW CARDS WILL NOT DO ANYTHING. PLEASE PM @Sc2ad#8836 ON DISCORD FOR CARD SUGGESTIONS (OR ANYTHING, REALLY)
