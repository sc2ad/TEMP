THIS IS THE CODE FOR BAX-ROULETTE (IN UTTERLY SIMPLIFIED FORM)
I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THIS CODE COMPILES, BUT DOES NOT NECESSARILY FUNCTION AS INTENDED (I HAVE TO GO TAKE CARE OF SOME THINGS IN REAL LIFE BEFORE I CAN MAKE THIS ACTUALLY WORK)

THE CODE ASSUMES THE FOLLOWING:
1. YOU HAVE A FILE CALLED: "BAXrouletteApp.txt" AND IT IS A DIRECT COPY PASTE OF THE GOOGLE DOC OF ALL OF THE OPTIONS (SEE THE EXAMPLE)
2. YOU HAVE A FILE CALLED: "BAXrouletteScores.txt" AND IT IS A FILE CONTAINING PLAYER IDs AND SCORES ONLY (SEE THE EXAMPLE)
3. YOU HAVE A DISCORD API KEY SAVED IN A FILE: "discord.key" (the file should ONLY contain this key. I obviously can't put mine here as an example).
